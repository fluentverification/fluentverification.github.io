Scalability has been a major limiting factor for SMC tools to analyze real-world systems with large or infinite state spaces. The infinite-state Continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model checker, STAMINA, tackles this problem by selectively exploring only a portion of a model’s state space, where a majority of the probability mass resides, to efficiently give an accurate probability bound to properties under verification. In this paper, we present two major improvements to STAMINA, namely, a method of calculating and distributing estimated state reachability probabilities that improves state space truncation efficiency and combination of the previous two CTMC analyses into one for generating the probability bound. Demonstration of the improvements on several benchmark examples, including hazard analysis of infinite-state combinational genetic circuits, yield significant savings in both run-time and state space size (and hence memory), compared to both the previous version of STAMINA and the infinite-state CTMC model checker INFAMY. The improved STAMINA demonstrates significant scalability to allow for the verification of complex real-world infinite-state systems.","tags":["stochastic model checking","infinite-state systems","markov chains","synthetic biology"],"title":"STAMINA 2.0: Improving Scalability of Infinite-State Stochastic Model Checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas Buecherl","Riley Roberts","Pedro Fontanarrosa","Payton J.

Similar to asynchronous electronic circuits, some combinational genetic circuits may show unwanted switching variations (_glitches_) caused by multiple input changes. Depending on the biological circuit, glitches can cause irreversible effects and jeopardize the circuit’s functionality. This paper presents a stochastic analysis to predict glitch propensities for three implementations of a genetic circuit with known glitching behavior. The analysis uses _STochastic Approximate Model-checker for INfinite-state Analysis_ (STAMINA), a tool for stochastic verification. The STAMINA results were validated by comparison to stochastic simulation in iBioSim resulting in further improvements of STAMINA. This paper demonstrates that stochastic verification can be utilized by genetic designers to evaluate design choices and input restrictions to achieve a desired reliability of operation.","tags":["genetic regulatory networks","genetic circuits","hazards and glitches","synthetic biology","model verification","stochastic simulation"],"title":"Stochastic Hazard Analysis of Genetic Circuits in iBioSim and STAMINA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

Exact results often cannot be obtained efficiently, so most tools use floating-point arithmetic in iterative algorithms that approximate the quantity of interest.

In this paper, we report on the experimental evaluation of these trade-offs performed in 'QComp 2020:' the second friendly competition of tools for the analysis of quantitative formal models. We survey the precision guarantees—ranging from exact rational results to statistical confidence statements—offered by the nine participating tools.
