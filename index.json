Crucial to the success of these efforts is the development of methods and tools for genetic design automation (GDA). While inspiration can be drawn from experiences with electronic design automation (EDA), design with a genetic material poses several challenges. In particular, genetic circuits are composed of very noisy components making their behavior more asynchronous, analog, and stochastic in nature. This workshop presents a design-build-test-learn workflow for synthetic biology. We will introduce data repositories that provide information about genetic parts, sequence-level design tools to compose these parts into circuits, and modeling and simulation tools to evaluate alternative design choices. We will also introduce basics about the experimental methods used to build and test these genetic designs. Finally, we will demonstrate how laboratory automation can accelerate this entire workflow.","tags":[],"title":"Synthetic Biology Workshop","type":"event"},{"authors":["Roman Andriushchenko","Alexander Bork","Carlos E.

Many application scenarios, however, require more advanced property types such as LTL and parameter synthesis queries as well as advanced models like stochastic games and partially observable MDPs. For these, tool support is in its infancy today. This paper presents the outcomes of QComp 2023: a survey of the state of the art in quantitative verification tool support for advanced property types and models.

The Stamina infinite-state PMC tool achieves scalability by iteratively constructing a partial state space for an unbounded continuous-time Markov chain model, where a majority of the probability mass resides. It then performs time-bounded transient PMC. It can efficiently produce an accurate probability bound to the property under verification. We present a new software architecture design and the C++ implementation of the Stamina 2.0 algorithm, integrated with the Storm model checker. This open-source Stamina implementation offers a high degree of modularity and provides significant optimizations to the Stamina 2.0 algorithm. Performance improvements are demonstrated on multiple challenging benchmark examples, including hazard analysis of infinite-state combinational genetic circuits, over the previous Stamina implementation. Additionally, its design allows for future customizations and optimizations to the Stamina algorithm.","tags":["markov chains","infinite state models","genetic circuits","hazards and glitches","synthetic biology","model verification","probabilistic model checking"],"title":"STAMINA in C++: Modernizing an Infinite-State Probabilistic Model Checker","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Landon Taylor","Bryant Israelsen","Zhen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689811200,"objectID":"8b829e45ad9337f450c2557438c4542f","permalink":"https://fluentverification.github.io/publication/cycle-and-commute/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cycle-and-commute/","section":"publication","summary":"Rare events are known to potentially cause pathological behavior in biochemical reaction systems.

However, since commercially available instruments are limited to droplet manipulation, our work addresses the need for accelerated integration of other components, such as temperature control, that can expand the application domain. We developed PhageBox—an accessible device that can be used as a biochip extension. At hardware level, PhageBox integrates temperature and electromagnetic control modules. At software level, PhageBox is controlled by embedded software containing a unique model for bio-protocol programming, and a graphical user interface for visual device feedback and operation. To evaluate PhageBox's efficacy for biomedical applications, we performed functional testing. Similarly, we validated the temperature control using thermography, obtaining a range of ± 0.2 ∘C . The electromagnets produced a magnetic force of 15 milliTesla, demonstrating precise immobilization of magnetic beads. We show the potential of PhageBox for bacteriophage research through three initial protocols a universal framework for PCR, T7 bacteriophage restriction enzyme digestion, and concentrating ϕX174 RF genomic DNA. Our work presents an open-source hardware and software extension for digital microfluidics devices. This extension integrates temperature and electromagnetic modules, demonstrating efficacy in biomedical applications and potential for bacteriophage research. We developed PhageBox to be accessible the components are off-the-shelf at a low cost ( ≤ $ 200), and the hardware designs and software code are open-source.

Despite the tremendous potential of this technology, there are significant challenges associated with its development and implementation. One of the major challenges with genetic circuits is the stochastic nature of their behavior. Unlike traditional engineering systems, genetic circuits are inherently probabilistic, which makes it more challenging to design and verify their performance. In particular, genetic circuits can exhibit rare failure states known as glitches, which are difficult to predict and prevent. To address this challenge, multiple stochastic simulation algorithms have been developed that use importance sampling as a variance reduction technique to estimate the probability of glitching behavior. However, these methods are often unreliable and impractical for use in design workflows. As a result, a mathematical analysis of these methods is necessary to identify the reasons why they fail to rapidly estimate low probabilities. To meet this need, we performed a comprehensive mathematical analysis of these methods to determine why they are ineffective in estimating low probabilities and to showcase their strengths and shortcomings. To achieve this end, we developed several case studies highlighting the challenges associated with these methods and their potential applications in genetic circuit design. This analysis provides crucial insights into the development of more effective algorithms for estimating the probability of rare glitching behaviors in genetic circuits. The results of this work will guide the future development of more applicable algorithms that can be used in design workflows to improve the reliability and predictability of genetic circuits. By overcoming the challenges associated with the stochastic nature of genetic circuits, these algorithms will enable the widespread adoption of genetic circuit technology in various fields, including biofuels, biomanufacturing, and medicine.","tags":["genetic regulatory networks","genetic circuits","hazards and glitches","rare events","synthetic biology","importance sampling","stochastic simulation"],"title":"Importance Sampling Techniques for the Analysis of Genetic Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bryant Israelsen","Landon Taylor","Zhen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681862400,"objectID":"ef44191497d848e939b673a91e0dc9f1","permalink":"https://fluentverification.github.io/publication/efficient-trace-generation-for-rare-event-analysis/","publishdate":"2023-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/efficient-trace-generation-for-rare-event-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"Rare events are known to potentially cause pathological behavior in biochemical reaction systems.

However, although automation works within these tools, most of these software tools are not integrated, and the process of transferring information between them is a very manual, error-prone process.

To estimate the probability of rare events efficiently, several weighted stochastic simulation methods have been developed. Under optimal parameters and model conditions, these methods can greatly improve simulation efficiency in comparison to traditional stochastic simulation. Unfortunately, the optimal parameters and conditions cannot be deduced a priori. This paper presents a critical survey of weighted stochastic simulation methods. It shows that the methods considered here cannot consistently, efficiently, and exactly accomplish the task of rare event simulation without resorting to a computationally expensive calibration procedure, which undermines their overall efficiency. The results suggest that further development is needed before these methods can be deployed for general use in biological simulations.","tags":["genetic regulatory networks","genetic circuits","hazards and glitches","rare events","synthetic biology","importance sampling","stochastic simulation"],"title":"Stochastic Hazard Analysis of Genetic Circuits in iBioSim and STAMINA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhen Zhang","Chris Winstead"],"categories":null,"content":"Data is exploding.

Inspired by engineering principles, researchers use defined parts to build functionally defined biological circuits. Genetic design automation (GDA) allows scientists to design, model, and analyze their genetic circuits in silico before building them in the lab, saving time, and resources in the process. Establishing SynBio’s future is dependent on GDA, since the computational approach opens the field to a broad, interdisciplinary community. However, challenges with part libraries, standards, and software tools are currently stalling progress in the field. This review first covers recent advancements in GDA, followed by an assessment of the challenges ahead, and a proposed automated genetic design workflow for the future.","tags":["genetic circuit design automation","standards","software tools","part libraries"],"title":"Engineering genetic circuits: advancements in genetic design automation tools and standards for synthetic biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riley Roberts","Thakur Neupane","Lukas Buecherl","Chris J.

Scalability has been a major limiting factor for SMC tools to analyze real-world systems with large or infinite state spaces. The infinite-state Continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model checker, STAMINA, tackles this problem by selectively exploring only a portion of a models state space, where a majority of the probability mass resides, to efficiently give an accurate probability bound to properties under verification. In this paper, we present two major improvements to STAMINA, namely, a method of calculating and distributing estimated state reachability probabilities that improves state space truncation efficiency and combination of the previous two CTMC analyses into one for generating the probability bound. Demonstration of the improvements on several benchmark examples, including hazard analysis of infinite-state combinational genetic circuits, yield significant savings in both run-time and state space size (and hence memory), compared to both the previous version of STAMINA and the infinite-state CTMC model checker INFAMY. The improved STAMINA demonstrates significant scalability to allow for the verification of complex real-world infinite-state systems.","tags":["stochastic model checking","infinite-sate systems","markov chains","synthetic biology","synthetic biology"],"title":"STAMINA 2.0: Improving Scalability of Infinite-State Stochastic Model Checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas Buecherl","Riley Roberts","Pedro Fontanarrosa","Payton J.

Similar to asynchronous electronic circuits, some combinational genetic circuits may show unwanted switching variations (_glitches_) caused by multiple input changes. Depending on the biological circuit, glitches can cause irreversible effects and jeopardize the circuit’s functionality. This paper presents a stochastic analysis to predict glitch propensities for three implementations of a genetic circuit with known glitching behavior. The analysis uses _STochastic Approximate Model-checker for INfinite-state Analysis_ (STAMINA), a tool for stochastic verification. The STAMINA results were validated by comparison to stochastic simulation in iBioSim resulting in further improvements of STAMINA. This paper demonstrates that stochastic verification can be utilized by genetic designers to evaluate design choices and input restrictions to achieve a desired reliability of operation.","tags":["genetic regulatory networks","genetic circuits","hazards and glitches","synthetic biology","model verification","stochastic simulation"],"title":"Stochastic Hazard Analysis of Genetic Circuits in iBioSim and STAMINA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos E.

Exact results often cannot be obtained efficiently, so most tools use floating-point arithmetic in iterative algorithms that approximate the quantity of interest. Correctness is thus defined by the desired precision and determines performance. In this paper, we report on the experimental evaluation of these trade-offs performed in 'QComp 2020:' the second friendly competition of tools for the analysis of quantitative formal models. We survey the precision guarantees—ranging from exact rational results to statistical confidence statements—offered by the nine participating tools. They gave rise to a performance evaluation using five tracks with varying correctness criteria, of which we present the results.","tags":["stochastic model checking","infinite-state systems","markov chains","synthetic biology"],"title":"On Correctness, Precision, and Performance in Quantitative Verification: QComp 2020 Competition Report","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
